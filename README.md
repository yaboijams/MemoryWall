# Memory Timeline - A Valentine's Project

## Project Overview
Memory Timeline is a web application designed as a personal and secure space for you and your significant other to store and relive shared memories. Users can upload images, write messages, and create a beautiful timeline of significant moments. The app features secure authentication, a polished user interface, and an engaging experience to make revisiting memories special.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (with a cool and cute styling library like Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI or Chakra UI)
- **Backend:** Node.js (Firebase Functions for backend logic)
- **Database:** Firestore (NoSQL database for storing user data securely)
- **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication (Google Sign-In, Email/Password, or other options)
- **Storage:** Firebase Storage (for storing images)
- **Hosting:** Firebase Hosting (for deploying the web app)
- **Animations:** Framer Motion (for smooth animations)

## Features
### Core Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure login using Firebase Authentication (Google, Email/Password, etc.)
- **Memory Upload:** Users can upload images, write captions, and add dates to memories.
- **Timeline View:** A beautifully designed timeline that displays memories in chronological order.
- **Private and Secure:** Only authenticated users can access their shared timeline.
- **Edit & Delete Memories:** Users can modify or remove their memories.
- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on mobile and desktop devices.

### Additional Features (If Time Permits)
- **Reactions & Comments:** Add fun reactions (hearts, emojis) or comments on memories.
- **Surprise Memory Feature:** A button that randomly selects and displays a past memory.
- **Custom Themes:** Let users personalize the look and feel with different color themes.
